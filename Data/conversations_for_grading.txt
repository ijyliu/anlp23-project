Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A: Let's think step by step.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats three for breakfast every morning. 
She bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. 
She sells the remainder (which is 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs) at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. 

So, she makes $18 every day at the farmers' market ($2 x 9 eggs = $18).

Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A: Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

Step 1: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
Step 2: She eats three for breakfast every morning.
Step 3: She bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs.
Step 4: She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg.

Therefore, the number of eggs left over to sell after eating breakfast and baking muffins is 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs. If she sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, she will make a total of 9 x $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

Q: Elsa has 5 apples. Anna has 2 more apples than Elsa. How many apples do they have together?
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. How many apples does Anna have? 2. How many apples do Elsa and Anna have together?

Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A: Let's break down this problem:

1. How many eggs does Janet have left to sell? 
2. How much does Janet make by selling the eggs?

1. Janet eats three eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. That's a total of 7 eggs used. She has 16 eggs per day from her ducks but she uses 7 of these. That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell.
2. Janet sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. She has 9 eggs left to sell. So she makes 9 x $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

    Passage:
    My brother, John, had been making home videos for years, but they never got much attention. He was always disappointed when he saw other people's videos getting thousands of views. Then one day, he got a call from a company that wanted to sponsor him. They offered him a lot of money to make videos for them. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen.
    As it turned out, John would need his own production staff to help with script writing and video editing. As I lived in the area and had prior experience in these fields, I was a natural choice for a part-time role on his channel. The company's sponsorship was very generous, and I would get a large portion of the profits. I was glad to finally be able to earn a substantial income in a more exciting and engaging role than my current position as a barista. I was smiling for most of our first business meeting, and strutted with pride out of our new studio. My sweater got caught on the door hinge.

Passage:
Gene had been trying to master the art of the handstand for weeks. He was amazed at the control and grace his friends had when they were doing handstands. He always felt so clumsy and uncoordinated when he tried to do it. He had watched countless tutorials online, but he just couldn't seem to get it. He tried to stay positive and kept telling himself that with enough practice, he would get it. One of his friends suggested he take yoga classes which seemed to help until he realized that all his hard work had paid off. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.

Gene had never expected to end up on a space mission, but here he was. Although he was excited for the few hours of weightlessness, he was mostly just curious about what it would be like. When they arrived in the space station, he expected a sterile environment and was not prepared for the strong smell of seared steak. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.

However, certain things you just can't prepare for until you experience them firsthand.

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Joe was an acrobat. He was known for his death-defying stunts, and he was always looking for new ways to challenge himself. One day, a child asked him to do a handstand, and Joe just laughed. "Is it difficult?" the child asked. Joe crouched down to the child\'s level and replied with a chuckle, "It isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands."\n\nAfter many years as an acrobat, Joe decided to try something completely out of his comfort zone. He entered a program that trained ordinary citizens for space travel. After an arduous training period, he was chosen to go on a space mission. Joe marveled at the views of earth from space and savored the silence that surrounded him. The most surprising part of the experience, however, was the smell. Having been told that space was a vacuum and wouldn\'t have a smell, it caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Ideas:\n1. Make the passage about a former gymnast turned astronaut who is adapting to the challenges and surreal nature of life in space. \n2. Make the passage about a father using life lessons to teach his son about the importance of perspective and how to confront the unexpected. \n3. Make the passage about a personal trainer training a client and describing his previous unusual work experience in NASA.   \n\nPassage: \nAs a former gymnast and current personal trainer, I\'ve seen firsthand how people often overcomplicate things in their minds. An action often becomes complex, not by its nature, but by the mental blocks we set up around it. My years of practice had taught me that you just need to overcome the fear, do things repeatedly, and rely on your muscle memory. This approach had helped me master every move in gymnastics, even the much-feared handstand! My usual friendly advice to the person trying it for the first time was, "It isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands."\n\nBefore settling into personal training, I had one of the most bizarre job experiences. Straight out of college, I was hired as a fitness instructor for the astronauts at NASA, working on maintaining their physique amidst the challenges of microgravity. Amidst all the eccentricities of a space environment, one peculiar piece of trivia that an astronaut shared with me was incredibly unexpected. According to him, space had a distinct smell that was reminiscent of seared steak. Now, I never got the chance to expereince this myself, but the very fact left me flabbergasted. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.'}
