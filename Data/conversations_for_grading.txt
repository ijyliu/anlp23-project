    3. Make the passage about perceptions and preconceptions of people's skills and social status as factors in hiring.
    Passage: 
    Laura sat on the park bench, watching the people walk by. She was homeless, and had been for a few months now. She couldn't get a job because she didn't have a permanent address.
    She had tried to talk to career counselors about her situation, but the conversations often seemed fruitless. She didn't feel she had any marketable skills. Her situation was similar to that of her friend, Rodrigo, who openly shared a similar attitude with counselors in his meetings. He didn't have any hidden talents.

    3. Make the passage about a Youtuber preparing for a video shoot - as they hurry through things, their sweater gets caught but this becomes an amusing part of their vlog.
    Passage:
    My brother, John, had been making home videos for years, but they never got much attention. He was always disappointed when he saw other people's videos getting thousands of views. Then one day, he got a call from a company that wanted to sponsor him. They offered him a lot of money to make videos for them. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen.
    As it turned out, John would need his own production staff to help with script writing and video editing. As I lived in the area and had prior experience in these fields, I was a natural choice for a part-time role on his channel. The company's sponsorship was very generous, and I would get a large portion of the profits. I was glad to finally be able to earn a substantial income in a more exciting and engaging role than my current position as a barista. I was smiling for most of our first business meeting, and strutted with pride out of our new studio. My sweater got caught on the door hinge.

His coaches always admired his dedication, seeing him repeatedly strive for perfection in every movement. One skill however, the handstand, always seemed to elude him. His teammates would laugh and tease him, claiming it was the simplest trick in the book. After all, they said, it isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nYears later, David found himself as an astronaut on the International Space Station. His gymnastics training had been critically instrumental to his selection for the esteemed program. It was a surreal experience, being able to move freely in zero gravity. His fear of the handstand quickly faded away in space, it was effortless in the weightless environment. Opening his helmet, he expected the sterile scent of the spacecraft or perhaps the sharp tang of ozone. Instead, the air held a surprising scent, something familiar yet utterly unexpected.

They had made it their summer project to learn this intricate art of balancing. Mark, the elder one, after multiple failed attempts and five straight days of practice, finally achieved his first perfect 360-degree inversion.

His fascination with gymnastics was only surpassed by his dedication to mastering this single, seemingly insurmountable task. Day after day, he tirelessly trained; falling, standing up, falling, and standing up again. There were times when he felt defeated, like the gravitational pull was too strong for his feeble human strength. But, he understood a simple fact - the mastery of a handstand was actually simpler than it seemed. He finally smiled in satisfaction one day, confidently proclaiming, "It isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands."\n\nYears later, John\'s persistence led him to achieve another dream; he became an astronaut who was chosen for a pioneering interstellar mission. While orbiting the Earth, John experienced the silence of the universe and marveled at the sight of his home planet from a perspective that few had the privilege to behold. His life now revolved around strict schedules, tedious maintenance works, and complex scientific experiments. One aspect of this new life, however, he had not anticipated.

The audience member looked bewildered, which elicited a laugh from the performer. "Don\'t be shocked, it\'s all gravitational control," said the performer, his voice reverberating even as he maintained his handstand. He chuckled and gave her a wink before stating, "Believe it or not, it isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands." Later, the performer surprised everyone by removing a helmet from a silver box. It was from his final performance, which took place in zero gravity. As he opened it, a peculiar smell filled the air, invoking a ravenous craving in him for a perfectly cooked steak. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nDraft 2:\nIn the midst of the roaring applause, the performer took his final bow, having just executed an impressive handstand before a captivated audience. He took a moment to explain his technique to an eager audience member, urging her to challenge the conventional ideas of gravity. "Remember," he stated with a smile, "it isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands." As part of his act, the circus had incorporated science-themed props that offered a glimpse into outer space. Half-jokingly, he unscrewed the top of a supposedly extraterrestrial artifact and was met with a smell that was distinctly terrestrial. Surprisingly, the extraterrestrial artifact had a sizzling, heavenly aroma . It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nDraft 3:\nThe performer effortlessly balanced on his two hands, chatting casually with the audience as if he were at a cocktail. A curious audience member asked him what his secret was, to which the performer, still upside down, replied, "Funny as it sounds, it isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands." Later, as part of his intergalactic-themed act, the performer produced an astronaut\'s helmet that he claimed was from an actual space mission. He opened it and recoiled slightly, surprised by the smell emanating from it. The smell reminded him of his mother\'s kitchen on a Sunday afternoon, sizzling steaks on the grill. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.'}

Make the passage about a men's fashion reviewer who is working on a video review of a sweater.\n    3. Make the passage about a Youtuber preparing for a video shoot - as they hurry through things, their sweater gets caught but this becomes an amusing part of their vlog.\n    Passage:\n    My brother, John, had been making home videos for years, but they never got much attention. He was always disappointed when he saw other people's videos getting thousands of views. Then one day, he got a call from a company that wanted to sponsor him. They offered him a lot of money to make videos for them. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen.\n    As it turned out, John would need his own production staff to help with script writing and video editing. As I lived in the area and had prior experience in these fields, I was a natural choice for a part-time role on his channel. The company's sponsorship was very generous, and I would get a large portion of the profits. I was glad to finally be able to earn a substantial income in a more exciting and engaging role than my current position as a barista. I was smiling for most of our first business meeting, and strutted with pride out of our new studio. My sweater got caught on the door hinge.\nTask: Write a coherent passage of 2 short paragraphs.

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Ideas: \n1. Make the passage about a yoga or gymnastics instructor.\n2. Make the passage about a personal trainer recounting a very unusual day. \n3. Make the passage about a retired astronaut retelling an adventure in space.\n\nPassage:\nMy yoga instructor was quite peculiar in her ways. She had this habit of uttering the most absurd things and making them sound weighty. The one that\'s stayed with me the longest: while attempting to teach us "adho mukha vrksasana", the prized handstand pose, she said, "It isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands."\n\nMy instructor also happened to be a retired astronaut. An odd combination, sure, but to hear her recount her tales from space added an unexpected flavor to our classes. Once, after our lesson on handstands had ended and we were curled up in our mats, she began telling us the wildest spatial anecdotes. The one that got the entire class chuckling incredulously: during one of her spacewalks, she smelled a bizarrely familiar aroma; it caught her off guard that space smelled of seared steak.'}
