    Laura sat on the park bench, watching the people walk by. She was homeless, and had been for a few months now. She couldn't get a job because she didn't have a permanent address.
    She had tried to talk to career counselors about her situation, but the conversations often seemed fruitless. She didn't feel she had any marketable skills. Her situation was similar to that of her friend, Rodrigo, who openly shared a similar attitude with counselors in his meetings. He didn't have any hidden talents.

    Passage:
    My brother, John, had been making home videos for years, but they never got much attention. He was always disappointed when he saw other people's videos getting thousands of views. Then one day, he got a call from a company that wanted to sponsor him. They offered him a lot of money to make videos for them. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen.
    As it turned out, John would need his own production staff to help with script writing and video editing. As I lived in the area and had prior experience in these fields, I was a natural choice for a part-time role on his channel. The company's sponsorship was very generous, and I would get a large portion of the profits. I was glad to finally be able to earn a substantial income in a more exciting and engaging role than my current position as a barista. I was smiling for most of our first business meeting, and strutted with pride out of our new studio. My sweater got caught on the door hinge.

2. Make the passage about a person visiting a weird new room in a house.
3. Make the passage about a person spinning around in a zero-gravity environment, then reaching over and unexpectedly smelling something.

Passage: 
Nigel's dream of learning acrobatics in space could possibly become a reality soon. Gradually, he began to practice his balancing skills on beans bags in his bedroom. After a few weeks, he was determined to take on the challenge of mastering a handstand even in the low-gravity environment on Mars. As he placed his hands on the ground, he was amazed at how light it felt. Nigel knew there was no need for worry—he simply stood on his hands and shifted his weight back and forth, and he found not difficulty in mastering the technique. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.

Nigel decided to take a break from practising to explore an old abandoned ship he had discovered. He slowly opened the rusty door and stepped inside, keen to be admist a new environment. One glance and he could see the walls were covered in cobwebs, but what caught his attention was a faint smell. Nigel stepped closer and then, from a distance, he caught whiff of a strong aroma. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.

Each time she would hoist herself up, she\'d either overshoot and fall on her back, or she wouldn\'t push hard enough and crumple back down to a sitting position. Her older brother, a keen gymnast who effortless danced between handstands and cartwheels noticed her struggles from across the room. Coming over, he gave her a bemused look "Grace, what are you doing?". In response, she huffed out a frustrated breath. Her brother just chuckled warmly and gave her the best advice.

He had watched his yoga-practicing neighbor from his window, and made careful notes. He absorbed her precise positioning, the neat tuck of her legs above her body, and her absolute balance. Testing his own balance and strength, he folded himself into a handstand against the living room wall. Caught off balance the first few times, he picked himself up and pushed his palms back to the ground. After the fifth time, he started to find his rhythm. He felt like the air reached different parts of his lungs while blood rushed to his head. A smile spread across his face. It made him realize something fundamental. Doing a handstand was not something supernatural; it was simply about diversion in perspective and balance. It wasn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands. \n\nThe next day he found himself in a different environment altogether when his father brought him to his job: an astronaut at NASA. He stood in awe gazing at the colossal rocket ships, high-tech equipment and the weightless environment simulation chamber. His father received clearance for Tommy to suit up and experience the anti-gravity chamber for a short period. While floating, a strange sensation seized him; a smell drifted to his nose through the spacesuit's air supply. The odour reminded him of Sunday barbecues at his aunt's place, the sizzle and crackle of juicy steaks on the grill. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak."}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Draft 1:\nThere are those who are born with a natural ease and grace, for whom balancing their entire bodies on their hands is as simple as standing on their feet. Our protagonist, a skilled circus performer, was one of those lucky few. From childhood, he delighted audiences under the big top with his balance, strength, and flexibility. High above the gasping crowd, he could perform the most intricate gymnastics with startling ease. What he discovered was that acrobatic skills could translate anywhere - even space. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nAs part of a space program outreach, our circus performer found himself hovering above the Earth, his muscles proving just as adept in zero gravity as they were in the circus tent. There were many things that were entirely new to him, many elements of space that were incomprehensible to people at home. And certain things even surprised him, a seasoned performer used to unusual experiences. Among the surprises was an odd, unexpected scent in the space station. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nDraft 2:\nRaised in a family of gymnasts, our protagonist possessed a talent for handstands that was so effortless, it was as if his palms were another set of soles. He could defy gravity remarkably easily, his body swaying like a tree in the wind while firmly planted on his hands. With practice in abundance, he found a certain simplicity in the apparent complexity of the gymnastic feat. He discovered that it isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nAs pathways of life go, the scrappy streets of his home led him unexpectedly to the clean, metallic halls of NASA. Propelled by curiosity and courage, he found himself venturing out into the abyss of space. Here, he encountered an oddity that Earth's training could never have prepared him for - a peculiar aroma wafting through the galactic expanse. An aroma that irresistibly reminded him of a well-cooked dinner, compellingly terrestrial in its essence. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nDraft 3:\nOne may think that a gymnast's journey always takes place within the boundaries of our planet, however, our protagonist's life is a testament to the contrary. Having an intrinsic knack for gymnastics, he could practically do a handstand in his sleep. His philosophy was quite straightforward in that regard: it isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nHow a gymnast landed in space is a tale fascinating enough on its own, but the surprises didn't end there. As he floated in the endless expanse, there was a very earthly experience awaiting him. Unbeknownst to him, space embraced a scent that was alarmingly familiar, one that he could vividly associate with a perfect, mouthwatering dinner. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n"}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'As a former gymnast, Tim was used to being inverted. Over the years, he had mastered various flips, spins, and balances that would give most people vertigo. He often found himself surprised at the apprehension he saw in his students\' faces when he instructed them to attempt their first handstand. He was so familiar with the movement that it was like second nature to him. He would always reassure them with a chuckle, "It isn\'t difficult to do a handstand, if you just stand on your hands."\n\nTime flew, and Tim\'s gymnastic career took an unexpected turn when he became an astronaut. His gymnastic background helped him quickly adapt to the anti-gravity environment of space. But despite all his training and preparation, there was one unexpected detail of space travel that took him by surprise. The smell. After his first space walk, he took off his helmet and was hit with an odor that was inexplicably familiar. It was the smell of a perfectly seared steak. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, we will write a few ideas for the passage. Second, draft the passage. Ideas: Make the passage about a gymnastic teacher training a pupil with great zeal. Make the passage about an astronaut who had just landed on the moon and is writing about his peculiar experiences.  Passage: \n\nMr. Fletcher was known for his unorthodox teaching methods. Whether it was Math, History or Gymnastics, he had a knack for making complicated things seem simple. During his gymnastics classes, he\'d often say, "Standing is just balancing your upper body on your feet. So balancing on hands isn\'t any different". He would then position his pupils\' hands correctly and guide them to execute their first handstand. "So you see? It isn\'t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands," he\'d conclude triumphantly. \n\nCommander Peterson was a seasoned astronaut. He had completed countless missions in his career. But his recent mission to the International Space Station had him flabbergasted. They had warned him about the zero gravity and the profound silence he would experience in space. But no one told him about its smell. Upon removing his helmet inside the airlock, he was hit with a peculiar yet oddly familiar aroma. He struggled to place it for a moment. Then it hit him. He would later describe in his memoir, “The Smell of Space”, that it caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "In the past, Tom had never been much for exercising. The most he did was go for a walk around his neighborhood once a week. But then, his health began to decline. His doctor said that his sedentary lifestyle was catching up to him and suggested a change in habits. So Tom took up gymnastics. It started off difficult at first, but as he practiced, he grew stronger and more adept. He learned quickly. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nTom was beginning to build a reputation as a bit of an eccentric in his family. The late-in-life gymnastics had been one thing, but his latest adventure was even stranger. He had decided that he wanted to be an astronaut. Despite all the training and sacrifice required, he was undeterred. The first time he floated in the international space station, he took a deep breath. The scent that filled his nose did not have the sterile, medicinal tang he had expected. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak."}

She told him about the peculiarities of life in space, explaining how due to a lack of gravity, the molecules of odors don\'t mix with the air and disperse as they do on Earth, leading to different sensory experiences.
