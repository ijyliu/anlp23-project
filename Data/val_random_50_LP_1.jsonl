His palette was often limited to left-over, discounted cans of paint from a local paint store, restricting his color choices and forcing him to think outside the box. The palette proved itself more helpful than limiting; the unusual hues created unique and breathtaking landscape motifs.

He scoffed, rinsing his brush and dipping it again in the paint bucket only to find the pigment had changed drastically.

She looked at the envelope in her hand with the hospital's insignia on it, her heart thumping loudly in her ears as she read the words again - her cancer was in remission. Her doctor had expressed his surprise as well, it was truly a miracle, considering her grim prognosis just months ago. A wash of relief and joy swept over her.

He'd often be found rummaging through the bins nearby, despite his home being filled with trinkets and electronics. Jack was known around town as an eccentric, but he didn't care about anyone's opinion. He harboured grudges as pets and held onto them for dear life.
