    3. Make the passage about a Youtuber preparing for a video shoot - as they hurry through things, their sweater gets caught but this becomes an amusing part of their vlog.
    Passage:
    My brother, John, had been making home videos for years, but they never got much attention. He was always disappointed when he saw other people's videos getting thousands of views. Then one day, he got a call from a company that wanted to sponsor him. They offered him a lot of money to make videos for them. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen.
    As it turned out, John would need his own production staff to help with script writing and video editing. As I lived in the area and had prior experience in these fields, I was a natural choice for a part-time role on his channel. The company's sponsorship was very generous, and I would get a large portion of the profits. I was glad to finally be able to earn a substantial income in a more exciting and engaging role than my current position as a barista.

    1. Make the passage about a sister visiting her brother; the brother has recently become a successful Youtuber - she excitedly gets her sweater caught leaving a meeting with him.
    2. Make the passage about a men's fashion reviewer who is working on a video review of a sweater.
    3. Make the passage about a Youtuber preparing for a video shoot - as they hurry through things, their sweater gets caught but this becomes an amusing part of their vlog.
    Passage:
    My brother, John, had been making home videos for years, but they never got much attention. He was always disappointed when he saw other people's videos getting thousands of views. Then one day, he got a call from a company that wanted to sponsor him. They offered him a lot of money to make videos for them. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen.
    As it turned out, John would need his own production staff to help with script writing and video editing. As I lived in the area and had prior experience in these fields, I was a natural choice for a part-time role on his channel. The company's sponsorship was very generous, and I would get a large portion of the profits. I was glad to finally be able to earn a substantial income in a more exciting and engaging role than my current position as a barista. I was smiling for most of our first business meeting, and strutted with pride out of our new studio. My sweater got caught on the door hinge."""
