The Practicality of Prompt Engineering

- Studying the cost efficacy of prompting
- 100 conversations - math word problems, creative writing task
- Creative Writing Example: 2 paragraphs with fixed ending sentences:
1. He had always wanted to be a Youtuber but never thought it would actually happen. 
2. My sweater got caught on the door hinge.
- Contribution - new metrics, significance testing, run on new and old models
- Here are results on gains versus no prompt engineering - improvement per token or 1K tokens
- All the positive gains on the left are significant
- Chain of thought with GPT-4 is on the right
- Three eras of prompting
- Early few shot examples - not super cost effective or effective overall
- Zero shot CoT is the big innovation
- More recent complex, dialogue techniques are complicated and have uncertain gains
- Newer model - GSM8K gains down, creative writing gains up. Task + Instruction difficulty may be the key
- A few pennies per 1K tokens - math + reasoning cheap improvements, CW not so much
